# Weather Dashboard
### Madison Scercy

This is a project that is made for people who want to check the weather in various locations. You can start by typing in your city and pressing search. On the right, the weather for today will show, and under it there will be the 5 day forecast showing the weather for the next five days. Your city history will stay there as buttons under the search bar, even after refreshing. You can click those buttons to get the weather for that city again.
